# Pink Programming Sunday

In May 2022 I held a Java workshop for beginners with Pink Programming at SEB in Stockholm.
It is a simple console app to demonstrate what the functionality of an ATM could look like in code, using object-oriented programming.

## Features
Features for the user include:
- Deposit money
- Withdraw money
- Check account balance

## Limitations

The application is console-only and thus does not include code that cover UI nor electronics. 
Two mock-accounts exist in the program for the demo. 
The user is currently not allowed to create a new bank account.
